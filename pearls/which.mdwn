Displays the pathname for a command.

* `which command` - Displays the absolute pathname to the program that
`command` would cause to be invoked.
* `which -a command` - As above, but displays all pathnames.
* `which command1 command2` - When invoked with multiple arguments, the
pathname for each command is listed, one per line.

When you enter a command in the terminal your shell executes a corresponding
program. For instance, `ls` may execute `/bin/ls`. This pathname is derived
from your 'search path' (the value of $PATH) and the command name. For each
directory in $PATH the shell determines whether $PATH/`command` exists and is
executable. The first such pathname it finds is the one executed. `which`
simply displays this pathname rather than executing it. 

This command is useful to discover which program a command is running when it
doesn't act as you'd expect.
