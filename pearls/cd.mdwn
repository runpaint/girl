Changes the working directory.

* `cd directory` - Changes the current working directory to `directory`.
* `cd` - Changes to your home directory.
* `cd -` - Changes to the last directory, i.e. your previous working
directory.
* `cd -P directory` - Changes to `directory` but refuses to follow symbolic
links.

## CDPATH

`cd` can use the _$CDPATH_ variable to determine where to find the directory
given. Its value is a colon-separated list of directories in which to search
for relative directory paths.

By default `cd` just looks in the current directory, so `cd dir` changes
the working directory to the `dir` subdirectory of the current directory. If
`dir` doesn't exist `cd` displays _No such file or directory_. If _$CDPATH_ is
set, `cd` looks in each of the named directories in turn to find the given
directory.

For example,

    export CDPATH=.:~ # Search the current directory then my home directory
    cd .vim # Looks for a .vim subdirectory of the current directory. If none
            # is found, look for it as a subdirectory of `~/`. If that fails,
            # exit with an error message.
