Detaches the given mountpoint from the filesystem.

* `umount /media/usbstick` - Un-mounts the device attached to
`/media/usbstick`.

`umount` is the converse of the `mount` command. Where `mount` makes the
filesystem of a device accessible from a given mount point, `umount` makes it
inaccessible. Any pending operations on the filesystem are completed, and its
contents are written to the associated storage device. In the case of
removable storage, un-mounting the filesystem allows the device to be
unplugged from the computer.

A device is said to be 'busy' if an application is using its filesystem. Such
devices cannot be un-mounted. For example, if `vlc` is playing a video file
from a CD-ROM drive, the drive cannot be un-mounted until playback is stopped.
A common gotcha is that devices are considered busy even if an application
merely has its working directory on their filesystem. So if you `cd
/media/usbstick` then `umount /media/usbstick`, the second command will fail
because your shell uses the mountpoint as its working directory.
