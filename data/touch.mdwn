Update a file's timestamp, or create an new, empty file.

Note: In all of the following examples if the file does not already exist it
is created as a new, empty file.

* `touch file` - Update the access and modification timestamps of `file` to
the current time.
* `touch -r file file2` - Sets `file2`'s timestamps to those of `file`.
* `touch -m file` - Update `file`'s modification timestamp to the current
time, leaving its access timestamp alone.
* `touch -a file` - Update `file`'s access timestamp to the current
time, leaving its modification timestamp alone.
* `touch -t 200602030910.02 file.tar` - Sets the timestamps of `file.tar` to
2006-02-03 09:10:02. Note: the seconds portion ('.02') and the first two
digits of the year ('20') can be ommitted, so `touch -t 0602030910 file.tar`
has the same effect.
